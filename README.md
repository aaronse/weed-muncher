## DESIGN
- GrinderFlex Mount
  - Design uses _stepped recess bore holes_, looked at [various bottom recess options](./docs/cads-flat-bottom-recess.htm)
   - To support grabbing weeds of varying thickness, the design uses linear spring compliant mechanism for resistive flex.  Goal is 30N or more resistive force, 3.5mm limited range of motion.
     - Considered [pros/cons of various materials for compliant mechanisms](./docs/compliant-mechanism-materials.htm)
     - Considered [various Open Source FEM software](./docs/fem-software-options.htm)
  - Intentionally spaced mount holes 1" OC for optional pegboard mounting.
