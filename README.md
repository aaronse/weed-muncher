# Project: Pet Sapling Savior, or, Pet Weed Euthanizer?

## Description
An Arduino‚Äêpowered, Mostly 3D‚Äêprinted weeder that grips unwanted plants, gently uproots them, and deposits sapling-worthy seedlings into your chosen grow tray‚Äîcombining garden cleanup, and with mini reforestation.

### WHY?
- I hate weeding, and avoid chemicals, plus I'd like to relocate otherwise unwanted saplings to areas needing reforesting, or, yards of people that like/deserve weeds üòâ.  
- I want AI machines to do my bidding, before they make me do theirs.
 
### WHAT's SPECIAL?
- Fast cordless yard fun way to relocate pet saplings, or, euthanize pet weeds.  
- Design includes many components that can be repurposed for other DIY tools.
- Today's [Best selling Weeders](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/lawn-garden/553934) are either designed for large deep rooted weeds.  They don't help with small weeds.  So today, people need to bend down, or kneel down, to grip and pull out small weeds.  
- Cutting/trimming weeds is fast for a day...  But, requires multiple cuts over long periods to eventually exhaust weeds.
- FluidNC controller boards doesn't require code, just upload config via WebUI, and go relocating/hunting...

## Functions
- Grip, pull and discard, or, collect for relocation.
- Normal grip and pull.
- Turbo grip and pull, mode for rapid munching, and suborbital sapling/weed launching.

- [ ] **Layer height** (e.g. 0.2 mm)
- [ ] **Infill** (e.g. 20 %)
- [ ] **Supports** (Yes/No + location)


### 6. Assembly Instructions
- [ ] Step-by-step bullets (e.g. ‚Äú1. Insert stepper into jaw housing; 2. Route wires through handle; ‚Ä¶‚Äù).
- [ ] Alignment or torque tips (e.g. jaw mesh clearance).

### 7. Demo & Usage Instructions
- [ ] Power-on and mode selection (Pull vs. Release).
- [ ] Operating tips (e.g. hold at 30¬∞ angle, watch for stall-flash).
- [ ] Safety note (keep fingers clear of gears).

### 8. Additional Notes & Tips
- [ ] Troubleshooting pointers (e.g. check wiring if it stalls).
- [ ] Optional enhancements (e.g. add LCD status display).

### 9. Photos & Videos
- [ ] Finished product: multiple angles.
- [ ] Wiring close-ups.
- [ ] In-action demo GIF or short video (pull + relocate cycle).

### 10. Final Packaging & Submission

## WHAT / WHY...
Semi-automated Weed Puller intended to be used for small broad leaf weed situations where GramPa's Weeder (and similar) are unable to grip.

For example, I have a ton of unwanted Maple tree weedlings.

## TODO/TASKS
- CAD Design edits
  - Prevent weeds sneaking behind, add funnel/guide?

  - Grinder Assembly
    - Grinder Core
      - Add lip to stop tire pulling towards Flex Mount plate
    - Grinder Tire
      - Reduce rotation angle so 0.4mm layer height slicer doesn't add "top" line segments. 
      - Prevent slip off: More bumps/recesses, or make existing bigger?
      - Modify design so Slicer 0.72mm wall width results in _inner hub wall_ and _tooth wall_ touching/bonding.

## HISTORY
- 1st Tire Print 
  - (3hr 12mins, 15% retractions) Slicer config: 2 walls, alternative wall, infill 20%, 0.32mm layer height
  - Stiffer than expected
- 2nd Grinder Tire print ()
  - (1hr 51mins, 11%) Slice config: 2 walls, 0.66mm, line width, NO alternative wall, 0% infill, 0.36mm layer height
    - ‚ö†Ô∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Counter intuitively, SAVED print time using 0.32mm layer height instead of 0.4mm.  Reason is steep overhang angle of the gear teeth results in more wall material being added, when laying thick layers like 0.4mm.  Added task to reduce rotation angle of sweep, so thicker faster single walls are possible, 
  - Goals flexible print that still grips Grinder Core

## DESIGN
- Grinder Flex Mount
  - Design uses _stepped recess bore holes_, looked at [various bottom recess options](./docs/cads-flat-bottom-recess.htm)
   - To support grabbing weeds of varying thickness, the design uses linear spring compliant mechanism for resistive flex.  Goal is 30N or more resistive force, 3.5mm limited range of motion.
     - Considered [pros/cons of various materials for compliant mechanisms](./docs/compliant-mechanism-materials.htm)
     - Considered [various Open Source FEM software](./docs/fem-software-options.htm)
  - Intentionally spaced mount holes 1" OC for optional pegboard mounting.

- Grinder Wheel Treads
  - Design has conical features with tiller
    - Fusion 360 Coils swept along spiral tapered path

- Pole to Grinder mounts
  - History/context:
    - Was concerned about 3D print being strong enough.  Designing and printing anyway to confirm/correct my understanding/theory with data...
    - Considered 3D printed like...

    - Considered common easy to source brackets.  Ideally 1" wide with centered holes.
