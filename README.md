# Project: Pet Sapling Savior, or, Pet Weed Euthanizer?


## Description
An Arduino or ESP32 powered, Mostly 3D‚ÄêPrinted Smart Pet Weed Euthanizer/Relocator that grips unwanted plants, gently uproots them.  Use to annihilate, or deposit sapling-worthy seedlings into your chosen grow tray‚Äîcombining garden cleanup, and with mini reforestation.

Inspired by conversations on V1 Engineering forum, see https://forum.v1e.com/t/how-about-a-m3dpmower/36759  topic for context/details.

Built two separate versions, a V1 Engineering Jackpot with FluidNC on ESP32, and, an Arduino Nano 33 IoT version.

Available on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1276001-pet-weed-euthanizer-or-pet-sapling-savior-in-progr), [GitHub](https://github.com/aaronse/weed-muncher).

### WHY?
- I hate weeding, and avoid chemicals, plus I'd like to relocate otherwise unwanted saplings to areas needing reforesting, or, yards of people that like/deserve weeds üòâ.
- Best selling Weeders are unable to grip smaller weeds/saplings like the ton of Maple tree ones that drove me to this. 
- This is Phase 1 of having IOT+AI powered machines to do my bidding, before they make me do theirs.
 
### WHAT's SPECIAL?
- Fast cordless yard fun way to relocate pet saplings, or, euthanize pet weeds.  
- Design includes many components that can be repurposed for other DIY tools.
- Uses mix of TPU infill/density and [Linear Spring Compliant Mechanisms](https://forum.v1e.com/t/linear-spring-compliant-mechanisms-designing-calculating-force-and-deflection/48891) to simulate pressure exerted by human hands gripping and pulling saplings/weeds without breaking them (well tries too...). 
- Today's chemical free [Best selling Weeders](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/lawn-garden/553934) are designed for either large deep rooted weeds, or, for people to bend and kneed down to grip and pull out small weeds by hand.  There's got to be a better way...  Maybe this DIY tool ?
- Pulling small saplings/weeds saves time compared to repeatedly cutting/trimming weeds until their root system exhausts and dies.
- **NO Coding** needed for FluidNC controller board based builds.  Just upload [config.yaml](fluidnc/config.yaml) via Web UI, restart, then go relocating/hunting...

## Functions
- Grip, pull and discard, or, collect for relocation.
- Normal grip and pull.
- Turbo grip and pull, mode for rapid munching, and suborbital sapling/weed launching. 

## 2. Software & Hardware

- [x] **Software List**: CAD/design tools and libraries...
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/), [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), [FluidNC](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/home)/[ESP3D](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D), [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360), [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/), [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/).

- [x] **Hardware List**: 
    - BOM contains latest set of parts that are working for me.  I tried many more components than what are listed here.  Let me know if you want to see the full list, only shared subset here to keep instructions straight forward.   
      - Recommend 2x Nema 17 84oz with 2x TMC2209 for max pulling fun :-)

  - The Weed Puller wakes up by setting up its buttons, rotary encoder, and motor drivers for smooth control and stall detection. It reads the Grind and Turbo buttons, the rotary encoder for speed adjustment, and the encoder switch to set the pulling direction.

  - Pressing Grind lets you pull weeds at a custom speed; Turbo gives you max power instantly. If the motors detect a stall, the system shuts them down and flashes a red warning until you're ready to go again. It also keeps an eye on weed distance with an ultrasonic sensor and shows real-time status over USB for easy debugging.

## TODO/TASKS
- CAD Design edits
  - Prevent weeds sneaking behind, add funnel/guide?

  - Grinder Assembly
    - Grinder Core
      - Add lip to stop tire pulling towards Flex Mount plate
    - Grinder Tire
      - Reduce rotation angle so 0.4mm layer height slicer doesn't add "top" line segments. 
      - Prevent slip off: More bumps/recesses, or make existing bigger?
      - Modify design so Slicer 0.72mm wall width results in _inner hub wall_ and _tooth wall_ touching/bonding.

## HISTORY
- 1st Tire Print 
  - (3hr 12mins, 15% retractions) Slicer config: 2 walls, alternative wall, infill 20%, 0.32mm layer height
  - Stiffer than expected
- 2nd Grinder Tire print ()
  - (1hr 51mins, 11%) Slice config: 2 walls, 0.66mm, line width, NO alternative wall, 0% infill, 0.36mm layer height
    - ‚ö†Ô∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Counter intuitively, SAVED print time using 0.32mm layer height instead of 0.4mm.  Reason is steep overhang angle of the gear teeth results in more wall material being added, when laying thick layers like 0.4mm.  Added task to reduce rotation angle of sweep, so thicker faster single walls are possible, 
  - Goals flexible print that still grips Grinder Core

## DESIGN
- Grinder Flex Mount
  - Design uses _stepped recess bore holes_, looked at [various bottom recess options](./docs/cads-flat-bottom-recess.htm)
   - To support grabbing weeds of varying thickness, the design uses linear spring compliant mechanism for resistive flex.  Goal is 30N or more resistive force, 3.5mm limited range of motion.
     - Considered [pros/cons of various materials for compliant mechanisms](./docs/compliant-mechanism-materials.htm)
     - Considered [various Open Source FEM software](./docs/fem-software-options.htm)
  - Intentionally spaced mount holes 1" OC for optional pegboard mounting.
